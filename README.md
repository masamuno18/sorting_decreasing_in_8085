# Sorting given data in an array in 8085 microprocessor simulator
* This is done as a part of the course curriculum and to provide algorithms to be available to others for academic purposes.
* In this repo there are two seperate assembly language program files named BUBBLE_SORT.asm and another is Selection_sort.asm. Bubble_sort file contains the bubble sort algorithm and selection_sort contains the selection sort algorithm for sorting given data in decreasing order.
