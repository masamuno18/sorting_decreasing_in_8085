# Sorting given data in an array in 8085 microprocessor simulator
* This is done as a part of the course curriculum and to provide algorithms to be available to others for academic purposes.
* In this repo there is an assembly language program file named BUBBLE_SORT.asm. Bubble_sort file contains the bubble sort algorithm for sorting a given array of data in 8085 simulator using GNUSims simulator.
